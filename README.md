# 📌 Predictive Maintenance System using Time-Series Analysis

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements a **predictive maintenance system** for industrial equipment using **time-series sensor data**. The system predicts equipment failures or estimates Remaining Useful Life (RUL), helping reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

It integrates **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **interactive dashboards** to deliver real-time insights. Suitable for industries like **manufacturing**, **energy**, and **transportation**.

> 🚀 This project showcases strong skills in time-series analysis, supervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and data visualization — making it a solid addition to any AI/Data Science portfolio.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Time-series preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Failure classification or RUL prediction using:
  - 🏡 Tree-based models (XGBoost / Random Forest)
  - 🧠 LSTM deep learning model
- Performance evaluation using metrics like RMSE, Accuracy, AUC
- Visualizations (sensor trends, feature importance, confusion matrix)
- Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions
- Modular, reusable Python codebase
- Cloud-deployed web app for public interaction

## 📊 Dashboard

The project includes a deployed [Streamlit app](https://your-deployed-app-link) where users can:

- Upload new sensor data (`CSV`)
- View predicted failure probability or RUL
- Interact with live plots and feature insights

## 🧪 Example Usage

### 🔧 Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedrefaeii/predictive-maintenance.git
cd predictive-maintenance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the App Locally

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard.py
```

### 📤 Upload CSV

Upload a file like this:

```csv
timestamp,temperature,pressure,vibration,...
0,35.6,1.02,0.003,...
1,35.8,1.03,0.002,...
...
```

> Sample available in `data/engine_data.csv`

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model Type      | Algorithm         | Task                      |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Tree-Based      | XGBoost, RandomForest | Classification / Regression |
| Deep Learning   | LSTM (TensorFlow) | Time-Series RUL Prediction |

Models are evaluated using:

- 📈 Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- 📉 Regression: MAE, RMSE, R²

Hyperparameter tuning done via `GridSearchCV` and `Optuna`.

## 📈 Visualizations

All plots are saved in the `plots/` folder:

- Sensor Trends  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve  
- Loss Curves  
- Feature Importance
